<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*IpUXpwNleNMgpPFr.png">

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
<p>Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores
in 7 European countries. Currently,
Rossmann store managers are tasked with
predicting their daily sales for up to six
weeks in advance. Store sales are
influenced by many factors, including
promotions, competition, school and
state holidays, seasonality, and
locality.<br> With thousands of individual
managers predicting sales based on
their unique circumstances, the
accuracy of results can be quite
varied. You are provided with
historical sales data for 1,115
Rossmann stores. The task is to
forecast the "Sales" column for the
test set. Note that some stores in the
dataset were temporarily closed for
refurbishment.</p>

<B>Steps taken:</B>
<ol>EDA and Data Manipulation</ol>
<ol>Hypothesis Forming</ol>
<ol>Feature Engineering</ol>
<ol> Train-Test_Split</ol>
<ol>Model Selection</ol>
<ol>Model Fitting</ol>
<ol>Model Evaluation and comparing performance metrices</ol>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<ol>There were more sales on Monday, probably because shops generally remain closed on Sundays which had the lowest sales in a week. This validates the hypothesis about this feature.</ol>
<ol>There is a high correlation between Customers and Sales.</ol>
<ol>Stores in close proximity had more sales than those with large competition distance. This can be due to busy location and accessibility factors.</ol>
<ol> Store type B though being few in number had the highest sales average. The reasons include all three kinds of assortments specially assortment level b which is only available at type b stores and being open on sundays and state holidays as well.</ol>
<ol>The outliers in the dataset showed justifiable behaviour. The outliers were either of store type b or had promotion going on which increased sales.</ol>

<h2>Recommendation:</h2>
<ol>Store type B should be increased in number</ol>
<ol>More store should be encouraged to have more assortment levels, as it leads to more sales.</ol>
<ol>Store must be encourage to do promotion as it increases the sales.</ol>
<ol> Drug is an essential commodity, so if possible, stores to try keep it open even on holidays, even if it is for a very short time.</ol>
